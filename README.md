# IndyGo Reservation App

### Prerequisites
You will need the following items installed on your system:
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* A Java IDE of your choice
Also, you will need to install an emulator through Android Studio, to simulate running the app on a real phone. It must be at least API level 19 (KitKat), although the most recest (30) is preferred.

### Running Instructions

### Testing
Due to the nature of the app, most testing was done visually. We ran the app and made sure everything did what it was intended to do (i.e. buttons sent you to the correct screen). We also made significant use of print statements, to show where something might be failing, or what data was being used. For testing our algorithms, like server capacity, we used exhaustive values (including edge cases) and tracked the state of the system, again with print statements. If we had more time, we would have liked to have written unit tests, but we did what we could.
